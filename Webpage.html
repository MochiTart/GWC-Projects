      <h3>Short Bio:</h3>
      <p>Hello! I’m currently a soon to be junior.
        I currently live with my parents, and I have an amazing sister (though she lives in Austin, Texas).
         I’m actually quite a huge nerd; I spend my weekends playing D&D and all sorts of video games.
         If I’m not doing either of those things, chances are I’m drawing or doing something music related
         (I’m definitely a band kid at heart!).
          When I have a little less time in my day, I’ll probably be watching YouTube videos
           (which all appropriately match with the hobbies I’ve just listed)
           or binging through some sort of show (there’s a very high chance that it’s an anime).</p>

      <h3>Next Year?:</h3>
      <p>It’s pretty well known that junior year is the hardest year,
        and I can definitely see why.
        I’m taking three SATS this year, and I also start IB
        (which will be very time consuming!). I'm also taking some notoriously difficult
        classes this year (physics and calc BC), so I've come to terms that I'll be
        having very little time to myself.
        I also have to start preparing my music repertoire for my college auditions
        (I plan on going into Music Technology!). In addition to that, I recently joined
        my school's honor band program, which also means an additional piece that I need
        to prepare...</p>

      <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
      <p>I’ve been playing the piano for eight years now,
         and I started competing in my freshman year.
         I've already performed at Carnegie Hall once!</p>
      <p>My Meyer-Briggs personality is <strong>ENTP</strong>. Maybe that explains why I can be so sassy?</p>
      <p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> reading <a href = "https://www.webtoons.com/en/">webtoons.</a>
      My favorite at the moment is Tower of God.
      It's arguably one of the most underrated webtoons out there, so go check it out!</p>
      <p>I'm really into the fantasy/sci-fi genre (but mainly the fantasy part).
         Actully, now that I think about it, it's pretty much all I read, and
         of the few shows that I watch, most of them also fall under this category.
         At the moment, my favorite show is RWBY (which of course, falls under this category).
         I actually just went to a convention for it last Friday!</p>
      <p>My favorite food is hot pot (yes, I understand that's technically a <em>style</em> of eating,
         but I honestly don't care about what you think :). I mean seriously, look at this beauty:</p>
